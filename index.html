        <p><b>Eleven</b> Palestinians were <b>killed</b> by Israeli security <i>forces</i> during operations in the Israeli-occupied <i>West Bank</i> <b>overnight</b>, Palestinian officials said Thursday, the <b>latest</b> in a surge of <b>violence</b> in the <i>West Bank</i> since Hamas' attack on Israel. The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that security forces killed “at least eight terrorists” during a “counter-terrorism operation” in the Tulkarem refugee camp that saw exchanges of fire with militants.</p>

        <p><b>What Palestinian agencies say:</b> Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that a <b>large</b> contingent of Israeli security forces entered Tulkarem on Wednesday. The forces searched homes, positioned snipers on rooftops, and closed streets to the free movement of residents, according to WAFA. At least <i>two people were killed</i> in a drone strike in Nur El-Shams camp near <i>Tulkarem</i>, WAFA said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said that two of its crew members were injured in an Israeli drone strike near its ambulance during the raid and five paramedics were arrested. Some Palestinians as young as 16 years old were arrested in Tulkarem, according to WAFA, adding that many of those detained and later freed said they were “severely beaten, abused, and threatened” by Israeli soldiers.</p>
